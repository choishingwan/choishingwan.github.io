	abstract = {Background—Danon disease is an X-linked disorder that leads to fatal cardiomyopathy, caused by a deficiency in lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2). In female patients, a later-onset and less severe clinical phenotype have been attributed to the random inactivation of the X-chromosome carrying the mutant diseased allele. We generated a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) based model of Danon disease to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Xi-chromosome reactivation using a DNA methylation inhibitor.
Methods—Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation (c.520C{\textgreater}T, exon 4) of the LAMP2 gene in a family with Danon disease. We generated iPSC lines from somatic cells derived from the affected mother and her two sons, and then differentiated them into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) for modelling the histological and functional signatures, including autophagy failure of Danon disease.
Results—Our iPSC-CM platform provides evidence that random inactivation of the wildtype and mutant LAMP2 alleles on the X-chromosome is responsible for the unusual phenotype in female patients with Danon disease. In-vitro, iPSC-CMs from these patients reproduced the histological features and autophagy failure of Danon disease. Finally, administration of DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the silent LAMP2 allele in iPSCs and iPSC-CMs in female patients with Danon disease, and ameliorated their autophagy failure, supporting the application of a patient specific-iPSC platform for disease modeling and drug screening.
Conclusions—Our iPSC-CM platform provides novel mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the contribution of random X-chromosome inactivation to disease phenotype in X-linked Danon disease.},

With the next generation sequencing technology, it is relatively easier to obtain a set of paired-end short reads from an individual (the donor). By aligning these reads onto a reference genome (the reference), we are able to detect some of the structural variations that exist between the donor and the reference. A number of tools were developed in this direction. However, these tools are not able to detect all types of variations. In particular, they do not perform well for the detection of tandem duplications which are found to be associated with some diseases. In this paper, we try to solve this problem and developed algorithm to identify novel tandem duplications that exist in donor and vice versa.

They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

	abstract = {Background
A recent large-scale mega genome-wide association study identified, for the first time, genetic variants at 12 loci significantly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we use a powerful polygenic approach, with polygenic scores derived from the genome-wide association study, to investigate the etiological overlap between ADHD and frequently co-occurring traits and disorders.
Methods
Polygenic risk scores for ADHD derived from the mega genome-wide association study (20,183 cases and 35,191 control subjects) were computed in a large-scale adult population sample (N = 135,726) recruited by the UK Biobank. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether polygenic risk for ADHD is associated with related traits and disorders in this population sample. The effects of sex were investigated via inclusion of an interaction term in the models.
Results
Polygenic risk for ADHD significantly and positively predicted body mass index (R2 = .45\%; p = 5 × 10−129), neuroticism (R2 = .09\%; p = 2 × 10−24), depression (R2 = .11\%; p = 2 × 10−13), anxiety (R2 = .06\%; p = 3 × 10−4), risk taking (R2 = .12\%; p = 9 × 10−25), alcohol intake (R2 = .09\%; p = 8 × 10−29), smoking (R2 = .33\%; p = 4 × 10−21), alcohol dependency (R2 = .21\%; p = 5 × 10−6), and negatively predicted verbal-numerical reasoning (R2 = .38\%; p = 5 × 10−36). Polygenic risk scores did not significantly predict schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, although this may be because of the small number of diagnostic cases. We found no interaction effects between polygenic risk for ADHD and sex on any phenotypes.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that common genetic variation underlying risk for clinically diagnosed ADHD also contributes to higher body mass index, neuroticism, anxiety and depressive disorders, alcohol and nicotine use, risk taking, and lower general cognitive ability in the general population. These findings suggest that the co-occurrence of several traits with ADHD is partly explained by the same common genetic variants.},

Typically they are linear combination of the genotypes of a large number of SNPs, with the weights calculated from an external source, such as summary statistics from large meta-analyses. Recently cohorts with genetic data have become very large, such that it would be a waste if the raw data were not made use of constructing PGS. Making use of raw data in calculating PGS, however, presents us with problems of overfitting. Here we discuss the essence of overfitting as applied to PGS calculations and highlight the difference between overfitting due to the overlap between the target and the discovery data (OTD), and overfitting due to the overlap between the target the the validation data (OTV). We propose two methods -- cross prediction and split validation -- to overcome OTD and OTV respectively. Using these two methods, PGS can be calculated using raw data without overfitting. We show that PGSs thus calculated have better predictive power than those using summary statistics alone for six phenotypes in the UK Biobank data.},

As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are also set to play a key role in personalised medicine. Despite their growing application and importance, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a disabling disorder affecting approximately 1\% of the population 
worldwide. Twins studies and family studies estimated that genetic factors contributes 
to 64\%-80\% of the liability of schizophrenia. With the development of 
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), a total of 108 common genetic loci associated 
with schizophrenia has been identified through the meta-analysis conducted 
by the Schizophrenia Working Group of Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). 
Using the summary statistic from the PGC schizophrenia GWAS, B. K. Bulik- 
Sullivan et al., (2015) estimated that the common variant contributes to around 
55.5\% of the liability of schizophrenia using LD SCore regression (LDSC). However, 
studies suggest that rare mutations, structural variance, copy number variation 
(CNV) and also genetic-environment interaction are all contributing to the risk 
of schizophrenia. This suggest that the estimate from B. K. Bulik-Sullivan et al., 
(2015) might be too high. An independent estimation of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
(SNP)-heritability of schizophrenia might provide insight as to whether 
if estimates from B. K. Bulik-Sullivan et al., (2015) are inflated. 
In this thesis, we developed SNP HeRitability Estimation Kit (SHREK), an 
alternative algorithm for the estimation of SNP-heritability. Our simulation results 
suggest that, SHREK provided a more robust estimate for oligogenic traits and for 
binary traits when no confounding variables was present when compared to LDSC. 
Most importantly, using the summary statistics from the schizophrenia GWAS, the 
SNP-heritability of schizophrenia is estimated to be 0.185 (SD=0.00450) by SHREK and 0.198 (SD=0.0057) by LDSC, suggesting that the estimates from B. K. Bulik- 
Sullivan et al., (2015) are inflated. Thus, the common variants contributes to less 
than 20\% of the liability of schizophrenia and it is likely for other genetic variants 
such as rare mutations and epigenetic factors to contribute to the heritability of 
schizophrenia. 
In addition, previous studies have reported the interaction between genetic variation 
and prenatal infection in the etiology of schizophrenia. There are evidences 
that the effect of prenatal infection is mediated by maternal immune response, thus 
it is likely for the perturbation induced by maternal immune activation (MIA) to 
interact with genetic variations in the development of schizophrenia. 
We therefore performed a RNA-sequencing study to investigate whether there 
are any genetic overlaps between differential genes induced by MIA and genetic variations 
detected by schizophrenia GWAS using the polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic 
acid (PolyI:C) mouse model. We found that the functional gene sets associated 
with schizophrenia are also enriched in MIA. In addition, when investigating the 
treatment effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) rich diet in MIA, we 
found that the gene expression of Sgk1, a gene that regulates the glutamatergic 
system, is affected by the n-3 PUFA rich diet in the PolyI:C exposed mice. Sgk1 is 
therefore a potential mediator of treatment effect of n-3 PUFA rich diet in the MIA 
model. In conclusion, our results suggested that genes related to neural function 
and calcium ion signaling, as well as glutamate-related genes such as Sgk1, are the 
potential targets for future schizophrenia research.},

	abstract = {Depression is more frequent among individuals exposed to traumatic events. Both trauma exposure and depression are heritable. However, the relationship between these traits, including the role of genetic risk factors, is complex and poorly understood. When modelling trauma exposure as an environmental influence on depression, both gene-environment correlations and gene-environment interactions have been observed. The UK Biobank concurrently assessed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and self-reported lifetime exposure to traumatic events in 126,522 genotyped individuals of European ancestry. We contrasted genetic influences on MDD between individuals reporting and not reporting trauma exposure (final sample size range: 24,094-92,957). The SNP-based heritability of MDD was greater in participants reporting trauma exposure (24\%) than in individuals not reporting trauma exposure (12\%), taking into account the strong, positive genetic correlation observed between MDD and reported trauma exposure. The genetic correlation between MDD and waist circumference was only significant in individuals reporting trauma exposure (rg = 0.24, p = 1.8×10-7 versus rg = −0.05, p = 0.39 in individuals not reporting trauma exposure, difference p = 2.3×10-4). Our results suggest that the genetic contribution to MDD is greater when additional risk factors are present, and that a complex relationship exists between reported trauma exposure, body composition, and MDD.},

	abstract = {Introduction It’s imperative to understand the specific and shared aetiologies of major depression and cardio-metabolic disease, as both traits are frequently comorbid and each represents a major burden to society. This study examined whether there is a genetic association between major depression and cardio-metabolic traits and if this association is stratified by age at onset for major depression.Methods Polygenic risk scores analysis and linkage disequilibrium score regression was performed to examine whether differences in shared genetic aetiology exist between depression case control status (N cases = 40,940, N controls = 67,532), earlier (N = 15,844), and later onset depression (N = 15,800) with body mass index, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in eleven data sets from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Generation Scotland, and UK Biobank.Results All cardio-metabolic polygenic risk scores were associated with depression status. Significant genetic correlations were found between depression and body mass index, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. Higher polygenic risk for body mass index, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes was associated with both early and later onset depression, while higher polygenic risk for stroke was associated with later onset depression only. Significant genetic correlations were found between body mass index and later onset depression, and between coronary artery disease and both early and late onset depression.Conclusions The phenotypic associations between major depression and cardio-metabolic traits may partly reflect their overlapping genetic aetiology irrespective of the age depression first presents.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: The use of cannabis has previously been linked to both depression and self-harm, however the role of genetics in this relationship are unclear. We aimed to examine the phenotypic and genetic relationships between these traits. Design: Genetic and cross-sectional phenotypic data collected through UK Biobank, together with consortia genome-wide association study summary statistics. These data were used to assess the phenotypic and genetic relationship between cannabis use, depression and self harm. Setting: UK, with additional international consortia data Participants N=126,291 British adults aged between 40 and 70 years, recruited into UK Biobank. Measurements: Genome-wide genetic data, phenotypic data on lifetime history of cannabis use, depression and self-harm. Findings: In UK Biobank, cannabis use is associated with increased likelihood of depression (OR=1.64, 95\% CI=1.59-1.70, p=1.19x10-213) and self-harm (OR=2.85, 95\% CI=2.69-3.01, p=3.46x10-304). The strength of this phenotypic association is stronger when more severe trait definitions of cannabis use and depression are considered. Additionally, significant genetic correlations are seen between cannabis use and depression using consortia summary statistics (rg=0.289, SE=0.036, p=1.45x10-15). Polygenic risk scores for cannabis use and depression both explain a small but significant proportion of variance in cannabis use, depression and self harm within a UK Biobank target sample. However, two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were not significant. Conclusions: Cannabis use is both phenotypically and genetically associated with depression and self harm. Future work dissecting the causal mechanism linking these traits may have implications for cannabis users.},
