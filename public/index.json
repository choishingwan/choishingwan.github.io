Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required. **Results:** Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software for automating and simplifying polygenic risk score analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative polygenic score software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power. **Conclusion:** PRSice-2’s combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated; for example, when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene-set based analyses.

This study examined whether there is a genetic association between major depression and cardio-metabolic traits and if this association is stratified by age at onset for major depression.\n**Methods:** Polygenic risk scores analysis and linkage disequilibrium score regression was performed to examine whether differences in shared genetic aetiology exist between depression case control status (N cases = 40,940, N controls = 67,532), earlier (N = 15,844), and later onset depression (N = 15,800) with body mass index, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in eleven data sets from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Generation Scotland, and UK Biobank.\n**Results:** All cardio-metabolic polygenic risk scores were associated with depression status. Significant genetic correlations were found between depression and body mass index, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. Higher polygenic risk for body mass index, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes was associated with both early and later onset depression, while higher polygenic risk for stroke was associated with later onset depression only. Significant genetic correlations were found between body mass index and later onset depression, and between coronary artery disease and both early and late onset depression.\n**Conclusions:** The phenotypic associations between major depression and cardio-metabolic traits may partly reflect their overlapping genetic aetiology irrespective of the age depression first presents.

Individual vulnerabilities and traits, such as preexisting mental health problems, may be associated with increased likelihood of experiencing bullying. Identifying such individual vulnerabilities and traits is essential for a better understanding of the etiology of exposure to bullying and for tailoring effective prevention.\nObjective  To identify individual vulnerabilities and traits associated with exposure to bullying in childhood and adolescence.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  For this study, data were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based birth cohort study. The initial ALSPAC sample consisted of 14 062 children born to women residing in Avon, United Kingdom, with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992. Collection of the ALSPAC data began in September 6, 1990, and the last follow-up assessment of exposure to bullying was conducted when participants were 13 years of age. Data analysis was conducted from November 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.\nExposures  The polygenic score approach was used to derive genetic proxies that indexed vulnerabilities and traits. A total of 35 polygenic scores were computed for a range of mental health vulnerabilities (eg, depression) and traits related to cognition (eg, intelligence), personality (eg, neuroticism), and physical measures (eg, body mass index), as well as negative controls (eg, osteoporosis).\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Single and multi–polygenic score regression models were fitted to test the association between indexed traits and exposure to bullying. Children completed the Bullying and Friendship Interview Schedule at the ages of 8, 10, and 13 years. A mean score of exposure to bullying across ages was used as the main outcome.\nResults  A total of 5028 genotyped individuals (2481 boys and 2547 girls) with data on exposure to bullying were included. Among the 35 initially included polygenic scores, 11 were independently associated with exposure to bullying; no significant association was detected for the 24 remaining scores. In multivariable analyses, 5 polygenic scores were associated with exposure to bullying; the largest associations were present for genetic risk relating to mental health vulnerabilities, including diagnosis of depression (standardized b = 0.065; 95% CI, 0.035-0.095) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (standardized b = 0.063; 95% CI, 0.035-0.091), followed by risk taking (standardized b = 0.041; 95% CI, 0.013-0.069), body mass index (standardized b = 0.036; 95% CI, 0.008-0.064), and intelligence (standardized b = −0.031; 95% CI, −0.059 to 0.003).\nConclusion and Relevance  Using the multi-polygenic score approach, the findings implicate preexisting mental health vulnerabilities as risk factors for exposure to bullying.

We identified parent-offspring pairs, siblings and couples in the UK Biobank and implemented a family-based DNA-derived heritability method to capture additional genetic effects and multiple sources of environmental influence on neuroticism and years of education. Compared to estimates from unrelated individuals, heritability increased from 10% to 27% and from 19% to 57% for neuroticism and education respectively by including family-based genetic effects. We detected no family environmental influences on neuroticism, but years of education was substantially influenced by couple similarity (38%). Overall, our genetic and environmental estimates closely replicate previous findings from an independent sample, but more research is required to dissect contributions to the additional heritability, particularly rare and structural genetic effects and residual environmental confounding. The latter is especially relevant for years of education, a highly socially-contingent variable, for which our heritability estimate is at the upper end of twin estimates in the literature. Family-based genetic effects narrow the gap between twin and DNA-based heritability methods, and could be harnessed to improve polygenic prediction.

Previous studies have proposed an R2 measure on the liability scale that can provide an accurate R2 for binary traits when the samples are ascertained, with the condition that both cases and controls are randomly sampled from their respective population. Biased in case control sampling, for example, cases obtained from hospitalized samples, or from volunteer (healthier samples), might lead to biased estimation of the phenotypic variance. It would be desirable to estimate the case severity if possible. Here, we propose a novel method for the detection of the direction of biased case selection and adjustment of the R2 estimate in polygenic score analyses. Using simulation and analytical analyses, we demonstrate that the Pearson Aitken Selection algorithm can be used to estimate an un-biased R2 and that the polygenic score distribution can be used to infer the case severity. Our algorithm estimated case severity with an accuracy of 93.7% and 61.9% for volunteer cases and hospitalized cases respectively. Our algorithm also consistently out-performed existing methods in providing an adjusted R2 when cases were non-randomly sampled from the population. In this study, we provide a novel approach for detecting bias in case sampling and we also provide an adjustment to the phenotypic variance explained (R2) in PRS analyses.","tags":["Polygenic Risk Score","Ascertainment Bias"],"title":"Detecting and Controlling for Biased Sampling in Case/Control PRS Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shing Wan Choi","Timothy Shin Heng Mak","Paul O'Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536883200,"objectID":"c1ccb4f6bdb5fcb69dc152a2d308dd16","permalink":"/publication/preprint/prs_guide/","publishdate":"2018-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/prs_guide/","section":"publication","summary":"The application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) has become routine across genetic research. Among a range of applications, PRS are exploited to assess shared aetiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the predictive power of genetic data for use in clinical settings, and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed on individuals, or their biological samples (eg. tissues, cells), at the tails of the PRS distribution and contrasted. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.

In this study we use a powerful polygenic approach, with polygenic scores derived from the genome-wide association study, to investigate the etiological overlap between ADHD and frequently co-occurring traits and disorders.\n**Methods** Polygenic risk scores for ADHD derived from the mega genome-wide association study (20,183 cases and 35,191 control subjects) were computed in a large-scale adult population sample (N = 135,726) recruited by the UK Biobank. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether polygenic risk for ADHD is associated with related traits and disorders in this population sample. The effects of sex were investigated via inclusion of an interaction term in the models.\n**Results** Polygenic risk for ADHD significantly and positively predicted body mass index (R2 = .45%; p = 5 × 10−129), neuroticism (R2 = .09%; p = 2 × 10−24), depression (R2 = .11%; p = 2 × 10−13), anxiety (R2 = .06%; p = 3 × 10−4), risk taking (R2 = .12%; p = 9 × 10−25), alcohol intake (R2 = .09%; p = 8 × 10−29), smoking (R2 = .33%; p = 4 × 10−21), alcohol dependency (R2 = .21%; p = 5 × 10−6), and negatively predicted verbal-numerical reasoning (R2 = .38%; p = 5 × 10−36). Polygenic risk scores did not significantly predict schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, although this may be because of the small number of diagnostic cases. We found no interaction effects between polygenic risk for ADHD and sex on any phenotypes.\n**Conclusions** Our findings suggest that common genetic variation underlying risk for clinically diagnosed ADHD also contributes to higher body mass index, neuroticism, anxiety and depressive disorders, alcohol and nicotine use, risk taking, and lower general cognitive ability in the general population. These findings suggest that the co-occurrence of several traits with ADHD is partly explained by the same common genetic variants.","tags":["Polygenic Risk Score","ADHD"],"title":"Association of polygenic risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with co-occurring traits and disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Shin Heng Mak","Robert Milan Porsch","Shing Wan Choi","Xueya Zhou","Pak Chung Sham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1494201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494201600,"objectID":"953be798b684e8a667814ff90655acf9","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/lassosum/","publishdate":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/lassosum/","section":"publication","summary":"Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a person's genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P‐value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.

In female patients, a later onset and less severe clinical phenotype have been attributed to the random inactivation of the X chromosome carrying the mutant diseased allele. We generated a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)–based model of Danon disease to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Xi-chromosome reactivation using a DNA methylation inhibitor. **Methods:** Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation (c.520CT, exon 4) of the LAMP2 gene in a family with Danon disease. We generated iPSC lines from somatic cells derived from the affected mother and her 2 sons, and we then differentiated them into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) for modeling the histological and functional signatures, including autophagy failure of Danon disease. **Results:** Our iPSC-CM platform provides evidence that random inactivation of the wild-type and mutant LAMP2 alleles on the X chromosome is responsible for the unusual phenotype in female patients with Danon disease. In vitro, iPSC-CMs from these patients reproduced the histological features and autophagy failure of Danon disease. Administration of the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine reactivated the silent LAMP2 allele in iPSCs and iPSC-CMs in female patients with Danon disease and ameliorated their autophagy failure, supporting the application of a patient-specific iPSC platform for disease modeling and drug screening. **Conclusions:** Our iPSC-CM platform provides novel mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the contribution of random X chromosome inactivation to disease phenotype in X-linked Danon disease.
