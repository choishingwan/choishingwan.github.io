Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required. **Results:** Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software for automating and simplifying polygenic risk score analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative polygenic score software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power. **Conclusion:** PRSice-2’s combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated; for example, when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene-set based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info ","tags":["Polygenic Risk Score"],"title":"PRSice-2 Polygenic Risk Score software for biobank-scale data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tabea Schoeler","Shing Wan Choi","Frank Dudbridge","Jessie Baldwin","Lauren Duncan","Charlotte M.

Individual vulnerabilities and traits, such as preexisting mental health problems, may be associated with increased likelihood of experiencing bullying. Identifying such individual vulnerabilities and traits is essential for a better understanding of the etiology of exposure to bullying and for tailoring effective prevention.**Objective**To identify individual vulnerabilities and traits associated with exposure to bullying in childhood and adolescence.**Design, Setting, and Participants**For this study, data were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based birth cohort study. The initial ALSPAC sample consisted of 14 062 children born to women residing in Avon, United Kingdom, with an expected date of delivery between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992. Collection of the ALSPAC data began in September 6, 1990, and the last follow-up assessment of exposure to bullying was conducted when participants were 13 years of age. Data analysis was conducted from November 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.**Exposures**The polygenic score approach was used to derive genetic proxies that indexed vulnerabilities and traits. A total of 35 polygenic scores were computed for a range of mental health vulnerabilities (eg, depression) and traits related to cognition (eg, intelligence), personality (eg, neuroticism), and physical measures (eg, body mass index), as well as negative controls (eg, osteoporosis).**Main Outcomes and Measures**Single and multi–polygenic score regression models were fitted to test the association between indexed traits and exposure to bullying. Children completed the Bullying and Friendship Interview Schedule at the ages of 8, 10, and 13 years. A mean score of exposure to bullying across ages was used as the main outcome.**Results**A total of 5028 genotyped individuals (2481 boys and 2547 girls) with data on exposure to bullying were included. Among the 35 initially included polygenic scores, 11 were independently associated with exposure to bullying; no significant association was detected for the 24 remaining scores. In multivariable analyses, 5 polygenic scores were associated with exposure to bullying; the largest associations were present for genetic risk relating to mental health vulnerabilities, including diagnosis of depression (standardizedtextitb = 0.065; 95% CI, 0.035-0.095) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (standardizedtextitb = 0.063; 95% CI, 0.035-0.091), followed by risk taking (standardizedtextitb = 0.041; 95% CI, 0.013-0.069), body mass index (standardizedtextitb = 0.036; 95% CI, 0.008-0.064), and intelligence (standardizedtextitb = −0.031; 95% CI, −0.059 to 0.003).**Conclusion and Relevance**Using the multi-polygenic score approach, the findings implicate preexisting mental health vulnerabilities as risk factors for exposure to bullying. A mechanistic understanding of how these vulnerabilities link to exposure of bullying is important to inform prevention strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Multi–Polygenic Score Approach to Identifying Individual Vulnerabilities Associated With the Risk of Exposure to Bullying","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

We aimed to examine the phenotypic and genetic relationships between these traits. **Design:** Genetic and cross-sectional phenotypic data collected through UK Biobank, together with consortia genome-wide association study summary statistics. These data were used to assess the phenotypic and genetic relationship between cannabis use, depression and self harm. **Setting:** UK, with additional international consortia data Participants N=126,291 British adults aged between 40 and 70 years, recruited into UK Biobank. Measurements: Genome-wide genetic data, phenotypic data on lifetime history of cannabis use, depression and self-harm. **Findings:** In UK Biobank, cannabis use is associated with increased likelihood of depression (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.59-1.70, p=1.19x10-213) and self-harm (OR=2.85, 95% CI=2.69-3.01, p=3.46x10-304). The strength of this phenotypic association is stronger when more severe trait definitions of cannabis use and depression are considered. Additionally, significant genetic correlations are seen between cannabis use and depression using consortia summary statistics (rg=0.289, SE=0.036, p=1.45x10-15). Polygenic risk scores for cannabis use and depression both explain a small but significant proportion of variance in cannabis use, depression and self harm within a UK Biobank target sample. However, two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were not significant. **Conclusions:** Cannabis use is both phenotypically and genetically associated with depression and self harm. Future work dissecting the causal mechanism linking these traits may have implications for cannabis users.","tags":null,"title":"Cannabis use, depression and self-harm: phenotypic and genetic relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SP Hagenaars","JRI Coleman","Shing Wan Choi","H Gaspar","MJ Adams","D Howard","K Hodgson","M Traylor","TM Air","TFM Andlauer","V Arolt","BT Baune","EB Binder","DHR Blackwood","DI Boomsma","A Campbell","M Cearns","D Czamara","U Dannlowski","K Domschke","EJC de Geus","SP Hamilton","C Hayward","I Hickie","JJ Hottenga","M Ising","I Jones","LA Jones","Z Kutalik","S Lucae","NG Martin","Y Milaneschi","B Mueller-Myhsok","MJ Owen","S Padmanabhan","BWJH Penninx","G Pistis","DJ Porteous","M Preisig","S Ripke","SI Shyn","PF Sullivan","J Whitfield","NR Wray","AM McIntosh","IJ Deary","G Breen","CM Lewis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"310a0daeedf494cd855314e19cacaf11","permalink":"/publication/hagenaars-genetic-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T19:35:58.755566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hagenaars-genetic-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"**Introduction** It’s imperative to understand the specific and shared aetiologies of major depression and cardio-metabolic disease, as both traits are frequently comorbid and each represents a major burden to society.

Both trauma exposure and depression are heritable. However, the relationship between these traits, including the role of genetic risk factors, is complex and poorly understood. When modelling trauma exposure as an environmental influence on depression, both gene-environment correlations and gene-environment interactions have been observed. The UK Biobank concurrently assessed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and self-reported lifetime exposure to traumatic events in 126,522 genotyped individuals of European ancestry. We contrasted genetic influences on MDD between individuals reporting and not reporting trauma exposure (final sample size range: 24,094-92,957). The SNP-based heritability of MDD was greater in participants reporting trauma exposure (24%) than in individuals not reporting trauma exposure (12%), taking into account the strong, positive genetic correlation observed between MDD and reported trauma exposure. The genetic correlation between MDD and waist circumference was only significant in individuals reporting trauma exposure (rg = 0.24, p = 1.8×10-7 versus rg = −0.05, p = 0.39 in individuals not reporting trauma exposure, difference p = 2.3×10-4). Our results suggest that the genetic contribution to MDD is greater when additional risk factors are present, and that a complex relationship exists between reported trauma exposure, body composition, and MDD.","tags":null,"title":"Genome-wide gene-environment analyses of major depressive disorder and reported lifetime traumatic experiences in UK Biobank","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shing Wan Choi","Timothy Shin Heng Mak","Pak Chung Sham","Paul O'Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"1baafd01f3caaccb13e770c3b647ef3d","permalink":"/publication/conference-paper/ascertainment/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/ascertainment/","section":"publication","summary":"In case control studies, samples are usually ascertained in a non-random way, where the sample prevalence might not represent the population prevalence of the trait, leading to biased estimate of the coefficient of determination (R2). Previous studies have proposed an R2 measure on the liability scale that can provide an accurate R2 for binary traits when the samples are ascertained, with the condition that both cases and controls are randomly sampled from their respective population. Biased in case control sampling, for example, cases obtained from hospitalized samples, or from volunteer (healthier samples), might lead to biased estimation of the phenotypic variance. It would be desirable to estimate the case severity if possible. Here, we propose a novel method for the detection of the direction of biased case selection and adjustment of the R2 estimate in polygenic score analyses. Using simulation and analytical analyses, we demonstrate that the Pearson Aitken Selection algorithm can be used to estimate an un-biased R2 and that the polygenic score distribution can be used to infer the case severity. Our algorithm estimated case severity with an accuracy of 93.7% and 61.9% for volunteer cases and hospitalized cases respectively. Our algorithm also consistently out-performed existing methods in providing an adjusted R2 when cases were non-randomly sampled from the population. In this study, we provide a novel approach for detecting bias in case sampling and we also provide an adjustment to the phenotypic variance explained (R2) in PRS analyses.","tags":["Polygenic Risk Score","Ascertainment Bias"],"title":"Detecting and Controlling for Biased Sampling in Case/Control PRS Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shing Wan Choi","Timothy Shin Heng Mak","Paul O'Reilly"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"e29973c2b9f44cc1e4cc9b8f04f2fc44","permalink":"/publication/choi-guide-2018/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T19:35:58.740478Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choi-guide-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) has become routine in genetic epidemiological studies.

In this study we use a powerful polygenic approach, with polygenic scores derived from the genome-wide association study, to investigate the etiological overlap between ADHD and frequently co-occurring traits and disorders.**Methods** Polygenic risk scores for ADHD derived from the mega genome-wide association study (20,183 cases and 35,191 control subjects) were computed in a large-scale adult population sample (N = 135,726) recruited by the UK Biobank. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate whether polygenic risk for ADHD is associated with related traits and disorders in this population sample. The effects of sex were investigated via inclusion of an interaction term in the models. **Results** Polygenic risk for ADHD significantly and positively predicted body mass index (R2 = .45%; p = 5 × 10−129), neuroticism (R2 = .09%; p = 2 × 10−24), depression (R2 = .11%; p = 2 × 10−13), anxiety (R2 = .06%; p = 3 × 10−4), risk taking (R2 = .12%; p = 9 × 10−25), alcohol intake (R2 = .09%; p = 8 × 10−29), smoking (R2 = .33%; p = 4 × 10−21), alcohol dependency (R2 = .21%; p = 5 × 10−6), and negatively predicted verbal-numerical reasoning (R2 = .38%; p = 5 × 10−36). Polygenic risk scores did not significantly predict schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, although this may be because of the small number of diagnostic cases. We found no interaction effects between polygenic risk for ADHD and sex on any phenotypes. **Conclusions** Our findings suggest that common genetic variation underlying risk for clinically diagnosed ADHD also contributes to higher body mass index, neuroticism, anxiety and depressive disorders, alcohol and nicotine use, risk taking, and lower general cognitive ability in the general population. These findings suggest that the co-occurrence of several traits with ADHD is partly explained by the same common genetic variants.","tags":["ADHD","Co-occurring disorders","Comorbidity","Genetics","Pleiotropy","Polygenic risk"],"title":"Association of Polygenic Risk for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder With Co-occurring Traits and Disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Mak","Robert Milan Porsch","Shing Wan Choi","Pak Chung Sham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"f9922921b33ec84c9c0cc5087d34af52","permalink":"/publication/mak-polygenic-2018/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T19:35:58.73824Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mak-polygenic-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Polygenic scores (PGS) are estimated scores representing the genetic tendency of an individual for a disease or trait and have become an indispensible tool in a variety of analyses. Typically they are linear combination of the genotypes of a large number of SNPs, with the weights calculated from an external source, such as summary statistics from large meta-analyses. Recently cohorts with genetic data have become very large, such that it would be a waste if the raw data were not made use of constructing PGS. Making use of raw data in calculating PGS, however, presents us with problems of overfitting. Here we discuss the essence of overfitting as applied to PGS calculations and highlight the difference between overfitting due to the overlap between the target and the discovery data (OTD), and overfitting due to the overlap between the target the the validation data (OTV). We propose two methods -- cross prediction and split validation -- to overcome OTD and OTV respectively. Using these two methods, PGS can be calculated using raw data without overfitting. We show that PGSs thus calculated have better predictive power than those using summary statistics alone for six phenotypes in the UK Biobank data.","tags":null,"title":"Polygenic scores for UK Biobank scale data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Shin Heng Mak","Robert Milan Porsch","Shing Wan Choi","Xueya Zhou","Pak Chung Sham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"a36c37a403ca5d08cd2d465af3f228ea","permalink":"/publication/mak-polygenic-2017/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T19:35:58.731825Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mak-polygenic-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a person's genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.","tags":["elastic net","lasso","Linkage disequilibrium","polygenic score","summary statistics"],"title":"Polygenic scores via penalized regression on summary statistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shing Wan Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"ea576d28de4cd73d5af99a7722067aae","permalink":"/publication/choi-greedyrelated-2017/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T19:35:58.734045Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choi-greedyrelated-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["GWAS","qc","relatedness"],"title":"GreedyRelated: Script for greedily remove related samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kwong-Man Ng","Pamela Y.

In female patients, a later-onset and less severe clinical phenotype have been attributed to the random inactivation of the X-chromosome carrying the mutant diseased allele. We generated a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) based model of Danon disease to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Xi-chromosome reactivation using a DNA methylation inhibitor. **Methods**—Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a nonsense mutation (c.520CtextgreaterT, exon 4) of the LAMP2 gene in a family with Danon disease. We generated iPSC lines from somatic cells derived from the affected mother and her two sons, and then differentiated them into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) for modelling the histological and functional signatures, including autophagy failure of Danon disease. **Results**—Our iPSC-CM platform provides evidence that random inactivation of the wildtype and mutant LAMP2 alleles on the X-chromosome is responsible for the unusual phenotype in female patients with Danon disease. In-vitro, iPSC-CMs from these patients reproduced the histological features and autophagy failure of Danon disease. Finally, administration of DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the silent LAMP2 allele in iPSCs and iPSC-CMs in female patients with Danon disease, and ameliorated their autophagy failure, supporting the application of a patient specific-iPSC platform for disease modeling and drug screening. **Conclusions**—Our iPSC-CM platform provides novel mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the contribution of random X-chromosome inactivation to disease phenotype in X-linked Danon disease.","tags":["autophagy","Danon disease","LAMP2 mutation","patient-specific iPSCs","Xi-chromosome reactivation"],"title":"Amelioration of X-Linked Related Autophagy Failure in Danon Disease with DNA Methylation Inhibitor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yung-Tuen Chiu","John K.

Twins studies and family studies estimated that genetic factors contributes  to 64%-80% of the liability of schizophrenia. With the development of  Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), a total of 108 common genetic loci associated  with schizophrenia has been identified through the meta-analysis conducted  by the Schizophrenia Working Group of Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC).  Using the summary statistic from the PGC schizophrenia GWAS, B. K. Bulik-  Sullivan et al., (2015) estimated that the common variant contributes to around  55.5% of the liability of schizophrenia using LD SCore regression (LDSC). However,  studies suggest that rare mutations, structural variance, copy number variation  (CNV) and also genetic-environment interaction are all contributing to the risk  of schizophrenia. This suggest that the estimate from B. K. Bulik-Sullivan et al.,  (2015) might be too high. An independent estimation of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism  (SNP)-heritability of schizophrenia might provide insight as to whether  if estimates from B. K. Bulik-Sullivan et al., (2015) are inflated.  In this thesis, we developed SNP HeRitability Estimation Kit (SHREK), an  alternative algorithm for the estimation of SNP-heritability. Our simulation results  suggest that, SHREK provided a more robust estimate for oligogenic traits and for  binary traits when no confounding variables was present when compared to LDSC.  Most importantly, using the summary statistics from the schizophrenia GWAS, the  SNP-heritability of schizophrenia is estimated to be 0.185 (SD=0.00450) by SHREK and 0.198 (SD=0.0057) by LDSC, suggesting that the estimates from B. K. Bulik-  Sullivan et al., (2015) are inflated. Thus, the common variants contributes to less  than 20% of the liability of schizophrenia and it is likely for other genetic variants  such as rare mutations and epigenetic factors to contribute to the heritability of  schizophrenia.  In addition, previous studies have reported the interaction between genetic variation  and prenatal infection in the etiology of schizophrenia. There are evidences  that the effect of prenatal infection is mediated by maternal immune response, thus  it is likely for the perturbation induced by maternal immune activation (MIA) to  interact with genetic variations in the development of schizophrenia.  We therefore performed a RNA-sequencing study to investigate whether there  are any genetic overlaps between differential genes induced by MIA and genetic variations  detected by schizophrenia GWAS using the polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic  acid (PolyI:C) mouse model. We found that the functional gene sets associated  with schizophrenia are also enriched in MIA. In addition, when investigating the  treatment effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) rich diet in MIA, we  found that the gene expression of Sgk1, a gene that regulates the glutamatergic  system, is affected by the n-3 PUFA rich diet in the PolyI:C exposed mice. Sgk1 is  therefore a potential mediator of treatment effect of n-3 PUFA rich diet in the MIA  model. In conclusion, our results suggested that genes related to neural function  and calcium ion signaling, as well as glutamate-related genes such as Sgk1, are the  potential targets for future schizophrenia research.","tags":null,"title":"The genetics of schizophrenia : the contribution of common variants and genes implicated in a maternal immune activation model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hung-Fat Tse","Jenny C.

With the next generation sequencing technology, it is relatively easier to obtain a set of paired-end short reads from an individual (the donor). By aligning these reads onto a reference genome (the reference), we are able to detect some of the structural variations that exist between the donor and the reference. A number of tools were developed in this direction. However, these tools are not able to detect all types of variations. In particular, they do not perform well for the detection of tandem duplications which are found to be associated with some diseases. In this paper, we try to solve this problem and developed algorithm to identify novel tandem duplications that exist in donor and vice versa. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets showed that our solutions are effective.","tags":["novel tandem duplication detection","structural variations"],"title":"Detection of Novel Tandem Duplication with Next-generation Sequencing","type":"publication"}]
