abstract: "In this paper, we report a novel heterozygous mutation of A285V codon conversion on exon 4 of the desmin (DES), using whole exome sequencing (WES) in an isolated proband with documented dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This mutation is predicted to cause three-dimensional structure changes of DES. Immunohistological and electron microscopy studies demonstrated diffuse abnormal DES aggregations in DCM-induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, and control-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes transduced with A285V-DES. DCM-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes also exhibited functional abnormalities in vitro. This is the first demonstration that patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to provide histological and functional confirmation of a suspected genetic basis for DCM identified by WES.
